6. copy con <filename> -- To create a file using CLI. This way we can understand the one of many
			  ways to create a file and also its metadata.

>copy con hello
Type something....here
and then press Ctrl+Z or F6

 File name can be any valid name and it might contains special characters as well as spaces.

c:\zeel>copy con address.me
101-PQR Society
Mehsana
^Z and then press enter

c:\zeel>dir  -- file, size, date/time of creation will be shown

Another way to create/open a text file using 'notepad'
c:\zeel>notepad sample.txt

Open an existing file,
c:\zeel>notepad address.me

7. copy sourceFile destiFile -- copy a file. To create a duplicate of "sourceFile" and the new file name will be "destiFile".

c:\zeel>dir
  address.me
c:\zeel>copy address.me address.your
c:\zeel>dir
  address.me
  address.your    <--- These two files have identical metadata and content except their names are
			different.

8. type  <filename> -- To view the content of file
c:\zeel>type address.me  <--- Will display the content of file

9. ren  <existingFileName>  <newFileName> -- To rename the file
c:\zeel>ren address.me address.kvp
    So, address.me filename is changed. See the content of directory using "dir" command

10. del or erase - erase/delete a file
    del <filename>

c:\zeel>del address.me   -- will be deleted permanately if it is there. You can't recover because
			   it won't placed into "Recycle bin".

11. dir command with switches - switches or option allow the command to produce somewhat different
				result as per documentation of switch/option.

>dir /p    <-- Pause wise listing
>dir /w    <-- Wide format listing
>dir /w /p <-- Wide and pause wise
>dir /b    <-- bare format (filename/foldername)
>dir /on   -- Order (sort) by filename/foldername) in ascending order
>dir /o-n  -- Order by filename in descending order
>dir /os   -- by size
>dir /od    -- by date time
 For descending order add - hyphen between on, os, od. e.g /o-s

12. Wildcard characters -- to create a group of files/folder based upon the filename filter.
    We've two wildcard characters (Wildcard means pattern)
    1. *  -- It represents whole name after the location 
    2. ? -- It represents single character

   Wildcard chars can be used with dir, copy, ren and del commands.

>dir ?   -- single char file names
>dir ??  -- Two or less char file names
>dir help*.* -- Any files whose name begins with "help"
>dir ?e??    -- Second char is e
>dir ??t*.txt -- Third char must be 't' and has txt extension
>dir *.txt    

Bulk copy
---------
>copy *.txt *.001
>copy help*.* help-2019*.*    

Bulk rename
------------
>ren *.cat *.mat

Bulk delete
------------
>del a*.*  -- Remove all files whose name begins with "a"
>del *.txt
>del *.*   --- Delete all file

Copy/ren files across the folders
=================================
Assume that we've c:\zeel\language\java folder and we want to copy all file from c:\zeel to "java" folder.

c:\zeel>copy *.* language\java

Or

c:\>copy c:\zeel\*.*  c:\zeel\language\java

c:\>tree zeel /f

Rename all .txt files to .abcd of "java" folder:
c:\zeel>ren langauge\java\*.txt *.abcd

Delete some files,
>del language\java\*.abcd


Merge the files and copy the content of merged files into another file.
>copy con z1
abc^z
>copy con z2
pqr^z
>copy con z3
eef^z

>copy z1+z2+z3 z4
>dir
>type z4


The > redirection of output using > operator
--------------------------------
To save the output of command into another file
e.g

c:\zeel>dir *.txt > txtfiles
c:\zeel>type txtfiles

c:\zeel>type address.me > newaddress.me  <-- New file "newaddress.me" save the output


Sort command (external)
------------------------
To sort the content of text document in asc or desc order

>copy con city
mehsana
ahmedabar
surat
rajkot


>sort city 
>sort /+2 city  sort on second character of each city name
>sort /R city   Descending order

more command (External)
=======================

To read the content from another command or from the file and display "page" wise.
e.g
>dir | more
>more city.txt 
>more city.txt /+10   -- begins with 10th line

Note: To end the "more" command press "Q"
