Operating System commands
=========================
There are three types of OS commands:
  1. Internal commands -- Commands which are part of the operating system and they will be 			  available forever with any version of window OS.
  2. Extenral commands -- Commands/tools which are external to the OS. They may be removed or
			  might be installed. External commands are found at c:\windows and
			 c:\windows\system32 folders and have .com or .exe extensions.
  3. Batch commands -- These commands can be internal as well as external but they are used
			to write small program instead of issuing a single command. i.e. this
			small program or small code or small script contains more than one
			commands (internal and external) and they will be run/executed in
			given order.  Batch program files have .bat or .cmd or .sh extension.
These commands are issued from the command prompt window OR Terminal or Command window Or WinKey+R (Run dialogbox). In Win OS, we can have another powerful command line interface called "Powershell" which is used by skilled developers and system manager to manage system-level tasks.

File system 
============
It is a system software which initialize the disks - harddisk, cdrom, dvd, pen, tape etc secondary storage devices and mount (keep alive) for us - users of the system so we can save data onto their medium.

Each disk has one or more partition and each partition has one or more volume(s). Each volume is than identified by a letter C, D, E, F etc and this letter is called 'drive-name'. In unix/linux, their file system don't support 'drive-letter' to identify the volume but it uses volume-name instead of 'drive-letter/name'.

And each volume has its own 'file system' which defines the ways to represent the data. Window uses FAT (File Allocation Table), FAT32 ( Improved over FAT), NTFS (Network File System - Currently used and high-performance), HPFS etc file systems. Linux uses EXT file system and similarly MAC OS has its own file system.

Now, each file system is then accessed via set of commands or instructions of operating system -- people uses GUI or CLI or Programming approach.

Installation of "File System" into a volume is called "Formatting a device/disk". Installation of "File System" create a "root directory or main directory" which is expressed via "/" (forward lash) in non-win os as well as win OS and "\" backword slash for Win OS.

Here are example of "prompt" -- a prompt is a location which receive the keyboard input or commands.

C:\>_
C:\Windows\System>_ <----- Prompt cursor   
^ ^       ^       
| |        |----------------------- Direcotry separator
| |------- Root direcotry
|
Drive 
  

Note: Don't work directly at "root" directory of any volume. Instead create your own folder and then try to work inside the scope of your folder or directory.

Folder or directory --- Folder or directory is used to organize the files and folders. In short directory saves the files and other directories.

Files -- File saves the data. In fact "file name" is an address of location inside the "disk-partition-volume" where your data are persisted. We can create / update files using number of ways i.e. generally using File + Save or SaveAs menu of GUI apps, or CLI commands (type, copy etc) or programatically.

Commands (Internals)
--------------------
First of all open the command window (WinKey+R + Cmd) - Cmd is an extenral command, and you will have following content in your command window:

c:\Users\user-namexxxxxx>_

You can open command window by typing "cmd" at "path bar" of  "File Explorer or My Computer window".

You can run file explorer by issuing "start ." or "start c:\path" command from the command window.

1. cd folder-dirname -- To change the current directory or to make given "folder-dirname" as 
			 current directory.
2. md folder-dirname -- To create the new direcotry into current directory
3. dir               -- To list the files/folders
3. rd folder-dirname -- To remove an empty folder


1. Practice

c:\Users\xxxxxx>cd\  + PRess Enter  to change at "root"
c:\>

c:\>md zeel
c:\>dir
c:\>md zeel
c:\>cd zeel
c:\zeel>dir

<dir>   .      <--- Current directory
<dir>   . .    <--- Parent directory

Create two more directories into c:\zeel>

c:\zeel>md office
c:\zeel>dir
c:\zeel>md practice
c:\zeel>dir   <--- Use dir command to list the files/folders

Further create two directories into "office"
c:\zeel>cd office
c:\zeel\office>md data
c:\zeel\office>md work
c:\zeel\office>dir

Make "work" as current directory:
C:\zeel\office>cd work
c:\zeel\office\work>

Now, make 'office' at current directory (or come out from work directory):
c:\zeel\office\work>cd..   .. stands for 'parent-directory' 
c:\zeel\office>cd ..
c:\zeel>cd..
c:\>tree zeel   <---- Will display all directories like a tree. Tree is an external command.

Now, remove the zeel direcotry and its sub-direcotires:

c:\>rd zeel <-- Can't remove
c:\>cd zeel
c:\zeel>cd office
c:\zeel\office>dir
c:\zeel\office>rd work
c:\zeel\office>rd data
c:\zeel\office>cd..
c:\zeel>rd office
c:\zeel>rd practice
c:\zeel>cd..
c:\>rd zeel
c:\>dir

Example: Write commands to create following directory structure

zeel-------|
           |--------language\
           |                 |
           |                 |---- C
           |                 |---- Java
           |-----database\
           |             |---- oracle-----|--- oracle11
           |             |                |---- mysql
           |             |---- nosql

c:\>md zeel
cd zeel


Construct the path to make current directory. A "path" is a way to express the location of folder or file and it has following syntax:
 Drive:\Folder\Sub\Sub

c:\>cd c:\zeel\language\c  <-- This will set "c" at current directory
c:\zeel\language\c>cd c:\zeel\database\oracle\mysql
c:\zeel\database\oracle\mysql>

You may remove the directories:
c:\>rd c:\zeel\language\c
c:\>rd c:\zeel\language\java


Root relative path
------------------
Where there is a common root then you can avoid the reference of drive letter or even root or parent directory name.

c:\>md zeel  or  c:\>md c:\zeel
c:\>md zeel\database Or c:\>md c:\zeel\database
c:\>cd zeel
c:\zeel>md language
c:\zeel>md language\c  OR md c:\zeel\language\c
c:\zeel>md language\java

To set 'mysql' at current dir:
c:\zeel\language\c>cd c:\zeel\database\oracle\mysql
Or
c:\zeel\language\c>cd ..\..\database\oracle\mysql



4. copy -- Copy the file(s)

syntax:  copy source-path destination-path

1. Open notepad and create "sample.txt" into c:\zeel\language\c folder
2. Open paint brush and create "hello.png" into "mysql" folder/

3. c:\>tree zeel /f  <-- Display all directories along with files

4. copy "sample.txt" to oracle folder

c:\>copy c:\zeel\language\c\sample.txt c:\zeel\database\oracle11\mysql
OR
c:\>copy c:\zeel\language\c\sample.txt c:\zeel\database\oracle11\mysql\sample.txt
Or

c:\zeel>copy language\c\sample.txt  database\oracle11\mysql
